<h2>Impact</h2>

Revive will have several layers of impact over several years of operation. Each layer will expand with each year of operation.


In phase one Revive will have a direct impact on those individuals who will learn about non-communicable diseases and who will receive early diagnosis through our tests. Additionally, those individuals we employ will have income which will positively impact their families.


In later phases, Revive will impact the local network of NGOs and partners by collaborating with them and working together to provide better health care solutions in the community. Through the collection of data, Revive will also be able to work with local governments and NGOs, like the World Health Organization, to help them better understand the health needs and characteristics of the slum communities.
