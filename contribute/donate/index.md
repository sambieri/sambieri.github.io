The money raised will support Revive's travel to the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, India to conduct field research and build partnerships. 


Additional funds will go to supplying the diagnostic tools and the first round of backpacks to be carried by health workers in the slums.
We have identified medical partners and NGOs in Europe and India to provide the tools at low/subsidized costs.


Training for our ambassadors will require one month and will be conducted with our outreach and NGO partners in Mumbai at no cost.


Donated funds will also go to the ambassadorsâ€™ salaries during the training stage.
