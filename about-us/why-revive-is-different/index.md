<h2>Why Revive is different</h2>

Revive is different because we are bringing a new type of healthcare service to the slums. Unlike existing services, our diagnostic tools are very simple to use and affordable. This means the cost is within reach of those slum dwellers who have some income. As a result, Revive can operate as a social enterprise, without charitable funding. 


The main differentiating factor however is that Revive will employ people from the slums to conduct the diagnosis and to move up to manage their local centers. The impact of Revive on employment, education, outreach, and disease diagnosis in the slums is what truly makes Revive a sustainable and different model.
