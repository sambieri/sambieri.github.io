<h2>Process</h2>

**Bringing healthcare into the slums, one backpack at a time.**


Revive  will work with community influencers in the slums to conduct outreach and early diagnosis of non-communicable diseases. We will provide training, mobile supply vans, and diagnostic tools to empower individuals to run programs in their own communities.  


The tools we use are simple and very affordable. The existing capabilities address diseases such as cancer, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and others. The tools have been developed through a global effort from the medical community to serve the world's poorest communities. After the initial success of several studies on the reliability of the simple and low cost tools, additional support for research into developing more tools has come from philanthropists such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Tata Foundation, and others. 


With a scalable franchise model, Revive will bring employment to the slums and can be replicated globally. Tailoring each Revive location to the local community and existing services will help us reach 25 million people in the first five years of operation.
